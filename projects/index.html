      <h5> <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/28shambhavi/arm_mpc">Control of dynamic model of two link arm using MPC</a></h5>
      <p>Model Predictive Control and Linear Quadratic Optimal Control of a two-link robot arm. Study of constructing dynamic models for robot manipulators and writing a controller for the two link arm model. The system's control algorithms of MPC and LQR were simulated in MATLAB and Simulink. The arm model was also visualised in Rviz using ROS and Python.</p>

     <h5> <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/28shambhavi/arm_mpc">Simulation and analysis of ad-hoc drone swarm networks</a></h5>      
      <p>The project studies communication networks of drones for deployment in disaster management and recovery. It included simulation of decentralised nodes using an ad-hoc TCP network on NS3 and NetAnim, developing an interface with ROS for simulating nodes on Gazebo, analysis of the network with nodes in T-formation, lawn mower etc. The project is yet to be published hence more information cannot be disclosed.
